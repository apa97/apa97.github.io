    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Alyssa, a SIAT student with a passion for web and 
      mobile development. I enjoy designing websites and apps, creating layouts that are 
      both functional and visually appealing. I’m still building my skills, but I’m eager 
      to learn and explore new tools and techniques. I like combining my creativity with technology 
      to develop projects that are engaging, user-friendly, and meaningful.

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <div class="projects">
      <div class="each-project">
        <h4>Espresso Coffee Company</h4>
        <p>A website developed using HTML and CSS to show a fictional coffee shop. This website 
          includes an interactive menu, information about products, with a clean, modern design. 
          I added responsive layouts so the website works on a range of different device sizes, from desktop 
          to mobile. This project helped me practice web design principles, HTML semantics and CSS styling.</p>

      <div class="each-project">
        <h4>Mindful Moments</h4>
        <p>A mobile app created using React Native to help users track mindfulness and 
          meditation activities. The app allows users to capture daily mindfuless through logging their 
          daily journaling. I focused on creating an intuitive interface and smooth navigation, so users
          will not have trouble navigating through the app. I made sure to keep the app simple and visually 
          appealing with calming and peaceful theme colours to help with the mindfuless effect. This project strengthened my skills 
          in React Native and in mobile UI design.</p>

      <div class="each-project">
        <h4>Munchie</h4>
        <p>A voice-based mobile app created using Protopie to prototype a food recipe app. The 
          app works by having a calendar that fits cooking time into the user's busy schedule, there is also a food 
          pantry to know the ingredients the user has at home so it can generate recipes with known 
          ingredients, and a recipe area where user's can find new recipes. My role was 
          to design the user flow, create realistic interactions, and test the usability. I had to make sure the 
          prototype felt engaging, user-friendly because we did have many elements and ideas to fit into this app. 
          This project helped me develop skills in interaction design (prioritizing the users needs) and prototyping.</p>
