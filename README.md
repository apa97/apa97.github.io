This website is my personal portfolio where I share a bit about myself, my skills, and some of the projects I’ve worked on. I built it using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. 

You can navigate between the pages using the navigation menu bar at the top, it only has HOME and VISUALIZATIONS for now. The homepage has my introduction, education, experience, and contact info. In another page called visualizations, this page shows a SVG bar chart and art. 

There is one small interactive element, you can click on name in the Homepage and it changes from black to pink. You can always change colours between the two colours (black and pink), you just need to click my name to see this interaction.
